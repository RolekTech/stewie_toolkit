# stewie_toolkit

The goal of this **toolkit** is to make it easy to use the same services across multiple applications.

I like using AWS Lambda, so this is built with some `statelessness` by default.

### The goals:
* Simple/light-weight
* Well tested
* "Rapid main app development" // aka, I never want to write these parts again.


## Service List
* Local config/app stuff
* AWS SDK
* Twilio SDK

### Why Stewie?
Stewie Butthole is my cat. He's my favorite pair programmer, so it just seems right to name it after him. :)

Plus, gives him some more lap time. ;)

"Squigg" or Lil Squiggle is his also, Evil brother. lol. 


# Setup
Install node via something. `Node v8.10.0` is what this is currently built in.
`NPM v5.6.0` is the current NPM version being used.

This has not been run on a Windows machine yet.

```$bash
npm install

```



## Running the tests
```$bash
// TBD
```
